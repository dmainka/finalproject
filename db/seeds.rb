Although its remarkable capabilities have made Ruby on Rails one of the world’s most popular web development frameworks, it can be challenging to learn and use. Ruby on Rails™ Tutorial, Second Edition, is the solution. Best-selling author and leading Rails developer Michael Hartl teaches Rails by guiding you through the development of your own complete sample application using the latest techniques in Rails web development. The updates to this edition include all-new site design using Twitter’s Bootstrap; coverage of the new asset pipeline, including Sprockets and Sass; behavior-driven development (BDD) with Capybara and RSpec; better automated testing with Guard and Spork; roll your own authentication with has_secure_password; and an introduction to Gherkin and Cucumber.",

You will learn how to use Git for source control and best practice techniques to create applications like a pro. Essential, and often-missed, information on testing and learning to program with Ruby are also covered.  This book is well suited for someone with little to no Ruby or Rails experience, or possibly even someone with no experience developing web applications at all. Beginning Rails 4 does assume a basic familiarity with the web and typical web terms, but doesn’t require you to be an expert of these. This book will springboard your journey into web application development, and show you how much fun building web applications with Ruby on Rails can be.",
